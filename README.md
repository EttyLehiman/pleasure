# Business Management Website ðŸ¤˜

This project is a website for managing a private business, such as a psychologist or cosmetician. The site is designed for use by both the business owner and regular users. Regular users can contact the business owner and view information about the business, while the owner can manage the business through the site.

## Admin Interface

Accessible via a separate route (`/admin`) and requires a username and password for login. It includes:

- **Business Details:** Address and contact information.
- **Services:** List of services with descriptions, prices, and durations.
- **Appointments:** Add, cancel, and modify appointments.
- **Clients:** List of clients.

## User Interface

Features include:

- **Home Page:** Information and advertisements about the site.
- **Book an Appointment:** Select service type, date, time, note to the owner, client name, and phone number.

Appointments are added to the admin interface. Users must message the owner to cancel appointments.

## Additional Features

- Users can send messages to the business owner independently of appointments.
- Admin has a messaging interface to manage communications.
- Regular users cannot access admin pages.

## Design Notes

The site has a basic and reasonable appearance, incorporating new learning experiences like design libraries and additional functionalities.
